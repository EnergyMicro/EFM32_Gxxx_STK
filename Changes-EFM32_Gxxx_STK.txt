================ Revision history ============================================
3.20.0:
- uC/OS-III real time os examples now use version 3.03.00 of uC/OS-III.
- uC/OS-II real time os examples now use version 2.92.07 of uC/OS-II.
- RTX real time os examples now use version 4.61 of RTX.
- Added Atollic and GCC ARM Embedded project files to examples projects.
- Added GPIO interrupt dispatcher example (gpiointerrupt).
- Added Non-Volatile Memory driver usage example (nvm_simple).
- Added RTX example with extremely low power consumption (rtx_tickless_nolcd).

3.0.3:
- Fixed userpage example for Keil toolchain.
- Added rtx_tickless example
- All examples need new EM_BSP_COMMON package.

3.0.2:
- Fixed bug in MPU example.
- Added Keil RTX RTOS example
- Added Micrium uC/OS-II/III examples
- Added powertest example

3.0.1:
- This release requires the EFM32_CMSIS_3.0.0 package
- Updated source and include files to CMSIS_V3
- Updated software license

2.1.4:
- Added SWO trace API for energyAware Profiler
- Added SWO trace capability to most examples
- Added binary .bin and .out files of all examples

2.1.3:
- Fixed Keil MDK-ARM project files, peripheral system view was missing
- Fixed UART initialization in ucos2 port

2.1.2:
- Added Changes and Readme files to delivery

2.1.1:
- This package requires EFM32_CMSIS_2.2.1
- Splitted out EFM32TG_STK3300 and EFM32_Gxxx_STK in to separate deliveries
- Refactored segmentfont.c to hold font information for LCD display
- Minor project fixes
- Updated BSP to work with most recent efm32lib, NOTE! USART_Reset() will now
  also clear USART_ROUTE register to not drive GPIO pins after the call.
  This means USART_ROUTE can not be called _before_ calls to USART_InitSync()/
  USART_InitASync()

2.0.2:
- Corrected inttemp (temperature sensor) gradient from datasheets
- Updated codesourcery makefiles to work under Linux (remove quotes)
- Don't enable lpref during VCMP warm up in vddcheck.c driver
- Corrected buttons, display and readout of temp. sensor example
- Added symbol information (debug) to all MDK-ARM builds

2.0.1:
- Fix restore of clocks in lcsense example (EFM32TG_STK3300)
- Fix ACMP Vdd scale for touch example (EFM32TG_STK3300)
- Reduce measurement time for capsense example (EFM32TG_STK3300)
- Added ' to segment lcd font

2.0.0:
- This release requires the EFM32_CMSIS_2.0.0 pakcage
- Added initial support for Tiny Gecko, board support package and examples
- All IAR projects now build with "Require Prototypes"
- All projects now have DEBUG_EFM (assert for efm32lib) enabled
- Moved LCD font definition into C file, added extern declarations to header
- Use efm32lib API for BSP
- Added const definition to segment LCD driver arrays (SRAM->flash)
- RTC driver now uses a prescaler to further reduce power consumption.
- Code improvements where direct writing to registers have been replaced with
  efm32lib calls.

1.2.0:
- EFM32_CMSIS_1.3.0 required for this release
- Updated examples to comply with latest EFM32_CMSIS updates
- Updated and corrected all project files; some project options were not
  correctly defined for various IDEs
- CHIP_init (drivers/chip.h) has been moved to EFM32_CMSIS efm32_chip.h,
  and renamed CHIP_Init to comply with efm32lib conventions
- Corrected segmentlcd driver, LCD_SYMBOL_DPx defines were invalid
- Added debug and release builds in CodeSourcery makefiles
- Added Micrium uC/OS-II example project (IAR EWARM and Keil MDKARM only)
- Added MPU example
- Added Internal Temperature Sensor example for RevC EFM32 devices

1.1.1:
- Rowley CrossWorks project files changed, file paths are now compatible
  with non-windows environments

1.1.0:
- Requires EFM32_CMSIS_1.2.0
- Updated all examples and drivers to use new efm32lib Peripheral APIs
- Added userpage example
- Cap.sense demo now uses ACMP efm32lib peripheral API
- Renamed some board specific drivers to separate clearer from efm32lib

1.0.4:
- Fixed IAR project files
